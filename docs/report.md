# ðŸ“„ Project Report: Face Detection using Viola-Jones (VJ) Algorithm

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to implement and evaluate a real-time face detection system using the Viola-Jones (VJ) algorithm. The project is developed as part of the **Digital Image Processing Design** course at **Inha University**. Our objective is to create an efficient face detector using OpenCV and Haar features.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Training
- **Cascade Classifier**: The face detection model is trained using a combination of public datasets and a self-made dataset that includes images of team members under various orientations, scales, and lighting conditions.
- **Data and Resources**:
  - [Training Data Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eKAg2KUzV6aSoDvpSEWK06y1WKEOHQiC?usp=sharing) - Contains datasets used for training and testing.

### 4.2 Testing and Evaluation
- **Image Size**: 1024 x 768 pixels.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Minimum detectable face size.
  - Maximum detectable face size.
  - Average detection time per image and per face.

## 5. Results

### Minimum and Maximum Detectable Face Sizes
The face detection script (`source.py`) was run, and the results for minimum and maximum detectable face sizes were captured in real-time. The detected sizes are as follows:

- **Minimum Detectable Size**: 30 x 30 pixels
- **Maximum Detected Size**:
  - Example 1: 283 x 353 pixels
  - Example 2: 344 x 429 pixels

#### Captured Images
![Max and Min Size Detection - Example 1](images/max-detect-size.png)
*Max Detected Size: 283x353 pixels*

![Max and Min Size Detection - Example 2](images/min-detect-size.jpg)
*Min Detected Size: 344x429 pixels*

### Average Detection Time
- **Per Image**: 0.0213 seconds
- **Per Image Per Face**: 0.01 seconds

## 6. Discussion
### Observations
- **Performance Analysis**:
  - The VJ algorithm is capable of detecting faces in real-time with a reasonable level of accuracy for different face sizes.
  - The results indicate that the face detector can successfully detect faces within a range of sizes, with the smallest detectable size being 30 x 30 pixels.
  
### Challenges and Limitations
- The accuracy of detection may vary depending on the presence of factors like:
  - Viewpoint variation
  - Deformation
  - Occlusion
  - Illumination changes
  - Cluttered or textured backgrounds
  - Intra-class variation

Further analysis will be conducted to evaluate the detectorâ€™s performance under these conditions.

## 7. Future Work
- **Performance Optimization**: Test the model under different lighting and orientation conditions to optimize its accuracy.
- **Additional Evaluations**: Determine the average detection time per image and per face to assess real-time efficiency.
- **Complete Documentation**: Update this report with a thorough analysis of detection challenges.
